Hello, I am Faegheh (Fay), a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [CVSSP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing), University of Surrey, working with [Prof. Adrian Hilton](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/adrian-hilton) on [AI4me](https://ai4me.surrey.ac.uk/index.html) project, a partnership project between the University of Surrey and BBC R&D to leverage AI for personalised media production. Previously, I completed my PhD at VI-Lab (now Mavi), University of Bristol, where I was awarded the university’s most prestigious and competitive PhD scholarship. During my PhD, I was supervised by [Prof. Majid Mirmehdi](https://majidmirmehdi.github.io/) and had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Björn Ommer](https://ommer-lab.com/people/ommer/) from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
