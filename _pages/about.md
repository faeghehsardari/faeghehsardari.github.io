Hello, I am Faegheh (Fay), a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [CVSSP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing), University of Surrey, working with [Prof. Adrian Hilton](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/adrian-hilton) on [AI4me](https://ai4me.surrey.ac.uk/index.html) project, a partnership project between the University of Surrey and BBC R&D to leverage AI for personalised media production. Previously, I completed my PhD at VI-Lab (now [MaVi](https://uob-mavi.github.io/people/)), University of Bristol, where I was awarded the university’s most prestigious and competitive PhD scholarship. During my PhD, I was supervised by [Prof. Majid Mirmehdi](https://majidmirmehdi.github.io/) and had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Björn Ommer](https://ommer-lab.com/people/ommer/) from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
